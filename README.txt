> 'Main_without_prior_info' is the fully data-driven code, while
'Main' has an informed tessellation.

> The time necessary to conduct one iteration is long, for a 32Gb
RAM it takes me around 20 min for each iteration.

> The rest are functions/files linked to 'Main' or
'Main_without_prior_info'.

> Not all comments are up to date : 'Main',
'Main_without_prior_info', 'TessellationFinder',
'TessellationFinderV2', 'TessellationFinderV3'.

> The rest of the files are good to go when it comes to comments.
